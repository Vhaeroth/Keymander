# Keymander
Large layout keyboard.

This is for personal backup or to provide core files to public for construction of the keymander keyboard.
The keymander keyboard is my personal keyboard layout that I built when I became frustrated by the limted about of keys on mechanical keyboards I was seeing and wanting to make full use of the QMK potential. 

This reporistory is not expected to be updated. I do not plan to provide any support for the keyboard. If you can't figure out what to do with the files above. You probly don't need them.
